# Arabic_OCR
This project focuses on developing an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system tailored for Arabic text, both handwritten and printed. Unlike Latin-based OCR, Arabic script presents unique challenges due to its cursive nature, context-dependent letter shapes, diacritics, and diverse handwriting styles.
